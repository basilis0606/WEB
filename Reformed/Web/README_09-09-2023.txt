//=================================== DB RELATED INFO ==========================================//
FIXED DB EXPORT: db_dump.sql

KNOWN ISSUES: The DB dump DOES NOT INCLUDE INDEXES, PROCEDURES, TRIGGERS AND EVENTS. Please insert 
them on your own from the proper github folders.
Important Notes: My DB triggers are from /Sql/V1 github folder. Not sure why we delete some triggers in 
V2 and V3. Do you want to review them again in a call, or should I simply delete them as well?

//============================= HELPING SCRIPTS RELATED INFO ===================================//
expotTables2JSON: converts sql table to json file. Needs fixing by hand afterwards
fixStoresId: replaced Ids in the original jsons we were given with the ones that we have in the db.
	     ot_patra and product_categories in the helping_scripts folder are the results of this
	     script. 
I don't even remember why I used these scripts, but I am sharing with you just in case. We'll 
probably delete them in the final version.
If you decide to use them, please keep in mind that paths might be different from what I have used.
