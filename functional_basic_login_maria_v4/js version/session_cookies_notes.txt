1) A cookie is created the moment you send a request to localhost (even before login).
I think it is overwritten every time you request whatever from localhost.
On every login, that cookie is overwriten according to the session data. 
Right now, this cookie expires in one day (almost, the timezone the parser uses is 
different, so it actually expires in 22 hours). If you wish to expire the cookie sooner,
you need to overwrite session data more often. (e.g. after every user action). 

2) userid in cookie or in session? --> session for safety

3) PASSWORD REGEX EXPLANATION
Original password_regex from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19605150/regex-for-password-must-contain-at-least-eight-characters-at-least-one-number-a
/^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[#$*&@])[A-Za-z\d#$*&@]{8,}$/ means

(^): match whatever follows, only if it is AT THE BEGINNING OF INPUT 
(?=someregex): match, whatever is before the "(?" only if it is followed by someregex.
.* : any non line-terminating character 0 or more times.
[A-Za-z\d#$*&@]{8,}: class that consists of any uppercase or lowercase letter, any digit 
                     or any of these special characters in 8 occurunces or more. 
$ (in the end): match whatever is before, only if it is AT THE END OF INPUT. 

[A-Za-z\d#$*&@]{8,}$ : guarantees 8 or more of the characters we are asked to include 
(?=.*[a-z]): match only if 0 or more non line-terminating characters are followed by a 
            lowercase letter.
Similar for the rest. They guarantee one occurunce of a lowercase and uppercase letter, one 
occurunce of a digit and one occurunce of the special characters we are asked to include. 

4) EXTRA FUNCTIONALITY: email or username already exists should be displayed on the register form 
(front end should understand it). Otherwise, respond with invalid email/username and try again.
